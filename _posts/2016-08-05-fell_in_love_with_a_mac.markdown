I was orginally going to post a blog about my adventures using virtual box to run Ubunutu on a pc. However on a recent trip to best buy I found a macbook air that was on discounted $300+ because th box was opened. I weighed the pros and cons. There are quite a lot of them, but in the end I bought the mac.

Now I have been a PC fan my whole life. I grew up building my own computers so naturally PC was the way to go. However things started to change a few days after using my Mac.  I find myself enjoying using my the MacBook more and more every day, in fact the only time I even used my PC was to change the wifi password after I moved. Sans using Adobe CC my PC will not be getting very much use anymore.

I still plan on creating video and blog post about running Ubunutu on a PC so stay tuned.
