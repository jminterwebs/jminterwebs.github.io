     My friends and I and big into fantasy football. So much so that in order to be in the league you must be present in person on draft day.  The first year it was way too borning. Everyone was on there own computer, there was no social interaciton at all. The next year I found a google doc spreadsheet to draft off of. I hooked up my laptop to a 60 inch tv and it worked great. That lead me to start to develop what is located at the above link. 
   
     Right now its a working concept. I wish it was more fleshed out but certain life situtaitons got in the way. The app was planned on being a full MEAN stack app. However now that I'm in Learn and the course work is Ruvy focused I might change the back end to reflect what I am currently learning. It also might be a good idea to build out both a Ruby back end and a Nodejs back end. I might actually be pretty simple because the app seams to be more front end heavy. That is also beacuse I really have yet to write a back end. 
     
     I'll jut have to see how what it develops into.
