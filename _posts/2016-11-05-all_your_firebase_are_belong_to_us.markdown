So I'm taking part in the Devfest hackthon in 14 days with a few fellow learners. One of the requirments is that we must use firebase. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).  Firebase isn't ruby however. Firebase is a mobile and web application platform with tools and infrastructure designed to help developers build high-quality apps. Firebase can also be mixed and matched to fit a teams needs. Team I am is still picking what features to use, we so far settled on using authentication, and database setup from Firebase. I'll keep this blog post short for now and go into a deeper dive of how Firebase works once I learn more.
