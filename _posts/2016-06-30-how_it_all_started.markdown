I have been teaching myself programming for quite a few years. It has had its ups, downs, and some long periods where I walked away. Nights with very little sleep, and even a few where I called it quits only to wake up at 2:00am and try something I just thought of. Learn is my final steps in a long awaited goal, to fully polish off my skills and transition into a career as a developer. 

I guess the best its best to start from the begining. A few years ago I found my self jobless. Durning a night out with my friends one brought up starting his own buisness. After a breif conversation we agreed that I would handle making a website for his new company. 

At the time my expirence with building webpages was playing around with Geocities as a kid in the 90s, and one brief lesson in a college class. So I settled in for the night fired up the old interwebs went over to Godaddy. In a few minutes I had a domain set up using Godaddy's featured website builder. After a few hours playing around with the builder I ran into some style issues related to something called CSS. That's when I reliezed I might be in a bit of a pickle.

The next day I hit the ground running. I ran up to a Borders books that was going out of buisness and bought a HTML and CSS book on the cheap. After reading the book and spending hours on youtube I got a decent handle on HTML and CSS. I thought everything was going fine and then I found JavaScript. So back to borders another book bought and more youtube. That first week I think I slept a total of six hours but loved every minute of it.
