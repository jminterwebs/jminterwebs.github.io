Ok I lied. I don't have summer vacation I haven't had on in 14 some odd years. However I did offically start Learn on June 28th which lines up pretty well with the tradtional summer vacation. Being that his weekend marks the unoffical end of summer I think now is a good time to look back and reflect on the past 8 or so weeks. 


My lifestyle is changing. 

This may be a bit  tangeltal but. I find myself going to bed easier every night and waking up more relaxed. I'm not as stressed out with general life anymore. I don't know if its I finally see a "light at the end of the tunnel" or that i'm just completly drained from a very full day, every day. This may be due to still working a full time job, and trying to commit to as much time I can on Learn each week. But I really don't care I enjoy feeling refreshed through out the day.

I'm starting to see code in everything. This especcially happens alot where I work. The systems and procdures I use I 'm realizing more and more each day that some of it can be automated, dumped into a little script and make my life and our coworkers lifes so much eaiser.  

Ruby just clicked one day. Learning Ruby got hard fast. I cruised through the in about a week and a half. Everything was firining on all cylenders and it just 'clicked.' Then something call OO Ruby happened. If Ruby is 'friendly' OO Ruby is what happens when friendly gets drunk at a bar and doesn't want to leave. I took me a while of pushing my self through the lessons, until everything finally clicked. It happened right around the time I watched one of the videos done by Avi. It was an awesome expriecne to finaly start connecting all the dots have that feeling of acomplishment. 

Time is my most valuable assest right now. Learn is making also relizethis. There are 24 hours in a day. That can not change, I cannot make more time.  My time management skills have gone from a 2/10 to a 9/10. Working and doing Learn has forced me to do this. I love it. 


Now looking foward. The course work up ahead looks challenging and there is still a lot of new material ahead and the units of how it will all tie together. I also need to commit to writing more techincal blogs. That's all I can think of for now.
